2. Assignment: Creating a Recipe Submission Button and Styled Form

Task 1: Add a button that links to a separate page for recipe submission. Include elements such as <button> with appropriate 
attributes and an anchor tag <a> to link to the submission page.

Expected Outcome: Utilize button and anchor tag elements to the page to allow users to navigate to another page for additional functionality.

Task 2: Use CSS to style the button with hover effects using pseudo-classes (:hover). Ensure that the button stands out and invites users to click.

Expected Outcome: Apply CSS pseudo-class styling to add visual appeal and provide additional queues to users.

Task 3: Create a separate HTML file for the recipe submission form. Include form elements such as <form>, <input> fields for recipe name, 
ingredients, and instructions, and a submit button <button>.

Expected Outcome: Utilize CSS elements for building forms to allow users to submit multiple data to forms. -->
